// DeliveryMode.  Transient means higher throughput but messages will not be
// restored on broker restart.  The delivery mode of publishings is unrelated
// to the durability of the queues they reside on.  Transient messages will
// not be restored to durable queues, persistent messages will be restored to
// durable queues and lost on non-durable queues during server restart.
//
// This remains typed as uint8 to match Publishing.DeliveryMode.  Other
// delivery modes specific to custom queue implementations are not enumerated
// here.
